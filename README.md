# About
**The program allows you to categorize text information based on downloaded examples. The project was created to interact with the coolswood author's project on the:**

* **[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coffye.mindhealthy&hl=ru&gl=US)**
* **[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/дневник-ментального-здоровья/id1568125612)**

**but it can also function as a separate system**

# Project structure
The project is structured for better scaling. In general, files names reflect their essence
* helper - contains the functions necessary for the program to work
* sql and config - contains the functions necessary for the program to work with MySQL database

# Selected libraries
* Django
* Djangorestframework
* Django-rest-knox
* Mysqlclient
* PyMySQL
* Typing
* Unitest
* Json
* String

# Installation
Download Python 3.8 or higher

```
git clone https://github.com/AlienFoun/Marcus
cd Marcus
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Fill in the data to connect to the MySQL database in the file `config.py`

# Usage

Open the terminal and go to the folder with the project, then start the server using the command `python manage.py runserver` after that, an API will be available to you, with which you can perform basic actions with the program

* The API for training will be available at `http://host:port/study/`

* The API for the response will be available at `http://host:port/reply/`

* The API for administration will be available at `http://host:port/admin/`

By default, `host` is `localhost`, and `port` is `4000`

For the program to work, you must first add to the database a list of categories and examples of words/phrases associated with this category using the training API or manually in a file study.py

* For further training, you can use the training API again

* To get an array of suitable categories, use the reply API.

The data transmitted by the API for training should be presented in json format as:
```Python
{
	"user_text": "text",
	"user_tags": ["tag1", "tag2", ..., "tagn"]
}
```

The data transmitted by the API for the response must also be presented in json format as:

```Python
{
	"user_text": "text"
}
```
You can also use the admin panel to train the algorithm without accessing the API. The data from the admin panel also gets into the learning algorithm and passes through it in the same way as the data that came through the API of this algorithm

# How it works?

## Study algorithm

After entering the program, the user's text will be cleared of any punctuation marks using the sanitizer function.

```Python
def sanitizer(clear_text: str) -> str:
    return clear_text.strip(string.punctuation)
```
After that, the text will be divided into fragments, first by 1 word, by 2, 3, etc. Words of less than 3 characters will be eliminated.
```Python
"I have a problem" -> ["have", "problem", "I have", "have a", "a problem", "I have a", "have a problem", "I have a problem"]
```
Then each fragment, depending on its length, will be assigned a "weight" that will affect the execution of the response algorithm

```Python
["have", "problem", "I have", "have a", "a problem", "I have a", "have a problem", "I have a problem"] ->
{'have': 1, 'problem': 2, 'I have': 2, 'have a': 2, 'a problem': 2, 'I have a': 2, 'have a problem': 3, 'I have a problem': 4}
```

Next, a check will be made for the presence of matches with words from the database for a certain category. In case of a match, the weight of the fragments will be increased

After that, this dictionary will be loaded into the database along with the tags in json format

| Tag | Words |
|:---------:|:---------:|
| Tag | {'have': 1, 'problem': 2, 'I have': 2, 'have a': 2, 'a problem': 2, 'I have a': 2, 'have a problem': 3, 'I have a problem': 4} |


## Reply algorithm

After entering the program, the user's text will be cleared of any punctuation marks using the sanitizer function.

```Python
def sanitizer(clear_text: str) -> str:
    return clear_text.strip(string.punctuation)
```
After that, the text will be divided into fragments, first by 1 word, by 2, 3, etc. Words of less than 3 characters will be eliminated.
```Python
"I have a problem" -> ["have", "problem", "I have", "have a", "a problem", "I have a", "have a problem", "I have a problem"]
```
Next, all the data for each category will be loaded from the database, after which the words of the input text will be compared with the words from the database and a list consisting of categories and their weights for a specific input text will be created. The list will be sorted and the first three categories will be displayed.

### Example

Input text:
```Python
{
	"user_text": "I have a problem"
}
```

Output message:

```Python
[
  	"tag1", "tag2", "tag3"
]
```
# Testing

For UNIT testing of functions, the unittest library is used. I have shown an example of testing the functions cutter, found_duplication, reply_output, weight_out_calibrator and word_dict_gen. In the examples, the output values of the function are based on the input data, with the specified output parameters.
